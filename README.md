Twitch-Discord-Clone

Description

Twitch-Discord-Clone is a frontend-only application that draws inspiration from the design of [kick.com](https://kick.com/). The decision to switch the Twitch UI design with Kick.com was made in favor of the latter's superior user experience. Kick.com, a platform similar to Twitch, provides a design that enhances the overall user interface and interaction.
